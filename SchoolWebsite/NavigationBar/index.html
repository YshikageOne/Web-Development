                According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
                Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
                The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

                    My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA.

            <p>The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). 
                He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. 
                He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with <a class = "shh" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbeeuzU5Qc8&t=8s&pp=ygUXd2hpc3RsZSBqb3NoIGh1dGNoZXJzb24%3D">brown</a>
                eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. 
                A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
